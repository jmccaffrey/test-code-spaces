What is this? - Codespace project I set up to test how it works

# What is the benefit of codespaces?

https://github.com/features/codespaces


That you can run a project on a linux instance, install all the stuff you need, test it out (browser ports are exposed), push up your changes, all from within your browser
 You could spin up a really beefy server to run your tests really quickly
  16core, 32g for $1.44 hr (cheaper than getting a new macbook)

AWS cloud9 could be similar - but this can be setup faster and you could add people to your team quickly


Following along from
 https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart

 You have to stop the codespace (cmd + P, then search for stop codespace) so that it doesn't keep billing you

# Haikus for Codespaces

This is a quick node project template for demoing Codespaces. It is based off of the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). It's great!!!
